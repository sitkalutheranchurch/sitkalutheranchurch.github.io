    <h1>GROW in Faith Formation - What Is a Lutheran?</h1>
    <p><strong><img src="img/luther-engraving.jpg" alt="Luther Engraving" width="200" height="302" class="floatR imgB" style="margin-left:35px;" />Martin Luther</strong> (b. November 10, 1483, in Eisleben, Germany, d. February 18, 1546, in Eisleben) is known as the Father of Protestantism. He had studied to become a lawyer before becoming an Augustinian monk in 1505 and was ordained a priest in 1507.  While continuing his studies in pursuit of a Doctor of Theology degree, he discovered significant differences between what he read in the Bible and the theology and practices of the church. On October&nbsp;31, 1517, he posted a challenge on the church door at Wittenberg University to debate 95 theological issues.  Luther's hope was that the church would reform its practice and preaching to be more consistent with the Word of God as contained in the Bible. </p>
    <p>What started as an academic debate escalated to major religious disagreements fueled by fiery temperaments and violent language on all sides. As a result, there was not a reformation of the church but a separation.  "Lutheran" was a name applied to Luther and his followers as an insult but adopted as a badge of honor by them instead. Lutherans still celebrate the Reformation on October 31. (See <a href="believe.php">“What we believe”</a> for more information). </p>
